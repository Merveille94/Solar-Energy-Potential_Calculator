# Solar Energy Potential Calculator

This is a web application that estimates the potential solar energy production for a given location. The application uses the NREL (National Renewable Energy Laboratory) Solar Data API to retrieve real-time solar radiation data, allowing users to understand the solar potential of their specific geographic area (Returns various types of solar data for US locations. ).

## Overview

The Solar Energy Potential Calculator is designed to help individuals and businesses estimate the amount of solar energy they can potentially harness at a given location. By inputting the latitude and longitude, users receive an estimate of annual solar radiation in kilowatt-hours per square meter (kWh/m¬≤).

## üåç Why This Matters

As we strive towards a sustainable future, understanding solar energy potential is crucial
for optimizing renewable energy use. This tool can assist researchers, developers, and anyone
interested in exploring solar energy possibilities, making it easier to plan for energy-efficient solutions.

## Features

- **Real-Time Solar Data**: Integrates with the NREL Solar Data API for accurate and up-to-date solar radiation information.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS for a responsive and intuitive user experience.
- **Simple Input**: Requires only latitude and longitude to calculate solar potential.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the project to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solar-energy-calculator.git
   cd solar-energy-calculator
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the necessary packages using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**

   Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application should now be running at `http://localhost:5174`.

## Usage

1. **Enter Location Details**: Input the NREL API KEY, latitude and longitude of the location you want to analyze.
2. **Calculate Solar Potential**: Click the "Calculate" button to receive an estimate of the annual solar radiation.
3. **View Results**: The estimated solar energy potential will be displayed, providing insight into the feasibility of solar energy production at that location.


## Requirements

- Node.js and npm
- An NREL API key
- A modern web browser for testing

## Development Timeline

This project was initially conceptualized in December 2023 as a C++ application. The web application development began in April 2024 and it's still underway using React and Tailwind CSS to provide a more interactive and accessible interface.

## Future Update

Planned future updates include:
- **Enhanced Data Visualization**: Add charts and graphs to better visualize solar potential over time.
- **Location Auto-Detection**: Integrate geolocation features for automatic latitude and longitude input.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure a seamless experience across all devices.
